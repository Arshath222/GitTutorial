KEYWORDS & IDENTIFIERS
 
TOKENS:
   tokens included keywords, identifiers, operators, special symbols etc. These are the building blocks for every C programs
  KEYWORDS - int,float, double, char etc
  IDENTIFIERS - var, myvar, fun_1
  OPERATORS - +,-,*,%
  SPECIAL SYMBOLS - (), {}
  main():
   The main() is not a keyword, but we should treat it as a keyword. because this is a special function
Keywords:
  Keywords are nothing but its reserved already by the language. Like keywords are Predefined. it's just to identify what type of datatype is that.
  It is mainly used to avoid the confusion while compiling a program, there are many keywords listed in c kanguage.
  Example: int, float, char, double, if, else, enum, while, do, for, break, case
  * We cannot use keywords as IDENTIFIERS
Identifiers:
  Identifiers are nothing but word or text used to identify anything in c language
  When we define a variable, function or structure we name them so that it becomes easier for us to identify 
  An Identifiers can only have alphanumeric character  and underscore
  The first character of an identifier can only contain alphabet 
  The identifier is just a name for the variables or constant etc.
  Ex: var1 , myfun1, var_1
  Identifiers are case sensitive like name and NAME are considered as different
  In the C Language Identifiers are the name given to
      * variables
      * constant
      * function
      * structure
      * pointers to identify them.
