BASIC SYNTAX RULES OF C
Intro:
  Syntax is nothing but its just a rules for the code lines, like how should the line of code start , how should end, where we need to use semicolon,
  where we need to use open, close braces these are including in syntax
 C Tokens:
   this is the smallest individual unit in C program. 
   Tokens are nothing but keywors, identifiers, constants or variables etc. C is having various collection of tokens
    Ex:
    printf(Hello world);
    printf----> token
    ()-----> token
    Hello world ----> token
    ; -----> token

Semicolon (;) every statement that ends with semicolon only , if you put the semicolon then only the next line is considered as new line , or else the line will continue through
Adding some commands:
    commands is nothing but just a simple text to understand the line of the part
 there are 2 types of commands are there 
   // - this is used for a single line command
   /* */ these is multi line commands , starts with /* and end with */

C is a case sensitive language so all will be written in lower case letters only 
   Ex: else is not same as ELSE

() - when we write a function its body is enclosed with the curly braces 
Example of basic syntax:
#include <stdio.h> ----> header file we included
{
int main () -----> main function is very important in that function only we will proceed the main function of a program
printf("Hello world"); ----. properly we put semicolon to tell that the line is end .
 return 0;
 } -----> to mention the program is finishes
