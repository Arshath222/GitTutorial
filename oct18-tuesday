C COMPILATION PROCESS 
in c compilation there are 3 processes 
  * Preprocessing
  * code compiling
  * libraries linking 

  Compilaton :
   The convertion of code that written in any programming language into understandable computer language is called compilation
   The software used for this convertion is called compiler

   Ex
     source code ----- > written by the user
        !
      compiler ----- > covertion process 
        !
      object code -----> 010110101101010

          At the compilation process it will check if there is any syntax or structure errors, no eeor found then it will generates the object code that has extension.obj
          linux extension.o

    In this full fledged process there are many steps are there
      * Pre processer
      * compiler
      * Assembler
      * Linker 

      Preprocessor
         This is the first process that preprocesser starts with # . 
         The word after # is called pre processer commands
         Ex : #include, #error

     Compiler 
        after preprocessing then it comes to compiling part, it will check for the syntax error and other structural error. if there is no erroe found
        then it will assemble the code and send it to the assembler
     Assembler 
        It is also a part of compilation. assemble all the codes into structured code
     Linker 
        Linker is used for some big programs, we can seperates the files & codes then we will link the two seperate files into 1 main files.
