* Features of C
    Modularity - resuable the modules
    Mid Level Language - combined architecture of low & high level language 
    Portability - C program can be compiled and executed in any OS ( unix, DOS, Windows)
    Powerful Programming Language - It is very efficient & powerful programming Language
    Standard Library - C is providing the strongest structured Library
    External Libraries - c is having tonees of external libraries
    Syntax Based Language lls

C is mainly focusing on Enterprise applications, games, graphics & application requiring calculatiion or simple software etc
